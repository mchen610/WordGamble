# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

I started developing this by myself alongside my friend Justin to learn React/Typescript and web development in general. 

## Things I learned

- Making cool animations with CSS

## More general thing I learned
- Updating code to become dynamic
- Debugging
- Searching StackOverFlow
- Putting myself in the shoes of the user
