# :slot_machine: Word Slots

## Things I learned from developing this React project
- Using [React Hooks](https://react.dev/reference/react) effectively
- How the re-rendering gets triggered and how it affects what's shown on the webpage and what the actual data values are at the same moment in time
- Learning industry conventions like naming interfaces with the convention `interface IProps`
- Making cool animations with CSS and learning how animations interact with each other; for example, if an element has two animations, the ones towards the left of the line of code are run last
- How to deploy a webpage on Github Pages
- Drawing bubble letters

## More general things I learned
- Updating code to become dynamic; this project started as a static 3x3 slot machine, but I re-coded it such that it would work exactly the same for any whole number.
- Debugging, especially related to the re-rendering interactions between the data and the webpage
- Searching [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) effectively to find guidance in any issues I ran into
- Thinking about how a user would be frustrated or pleased by any part of the user experience and adjusting my program accordingly
