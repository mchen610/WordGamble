# Word Slots

I started developing this by myself alongside my friend Justin to learn React/Typescript and web development in general. 

## Things I learned 
- How React Hooks work
- Using the type safety aspect of TS
- Making cool animations with CSS

## More general thing I learned
- Updating code to become dynamic
- Debugging
- Searching StackOverFlow
- Putting myself in the shoes of the user
